## Descripion
-The goal was to create a website to act as a biography and body of work for the author (me) 
- I wanted to have links at the top to navigate thoguh the webpage in the envt that it gets populated with enough information but at the moment isnt very nessasary.
- all of the links are set upi but are as yet not functional


## Notes
- I would have perfered to make the site less... corprate looking and more colourful but unfrtunatly i am still figuring out css and html to an extent so i view this site as a work in progress and not the final desired product.
